The Kaunter Windows Binaries
============================

Just bear in mind that for TheKaunter to work, the configuration file
(theKaunter.conf) must be in the same folder that theKaunter.exe

The translation file theKaunter.qm could be missing as far as you don't
want other GUI language than English
