What is it?
===========

TheKaunter is a multi-category, fully configurable differential counter.

Differential counters are used in fields like haematology, for counting blood cells or marine science, for counting different kinds of plankton organisms (eggs, larvae...), for instance.

Classic (mechanical) differential counters have up to 10 individual counters and one totalizer. TheKaunter features the possibility of having several categories or groups of counters with one totalizer by category and, unlike mechanical counters, TheKaunter makes possible to reset individual counters and decrease the count.
