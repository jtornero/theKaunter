# The Kaunter sample configuration file
# ======================================

# Overall info for configuration of TheKaunter
# --------------------------------------
# Each [Section] comprises one or more [[counters]] in which 
# a key binding must be defined by the parameter KeyBinding=key.
# Valid KeyBinding values are those in the range A-Z and 0-9.
# TheKaunter is case-insensitive. Bear in mind that, despite it is
# possible to define a big number of sections/counters, there are
# some practical limits = key bindings (36 possible) and also screen
# size (it's # probably impractical to define more than 25-30 counters.
# Practical limits (screen/widget size) apply also to the length of
# section/counter names. However, it is possible to use multi-word
# names, as shown in this example file. Linebreaks have no effect.

# Section Colors
#---------------
# Section colors can be defined with the keyword sectionColor after [Section]
# declaration. The color affects to the header of the section as well as
# to the background of the line edit widgets.
# For color definition, using HTML/X11 named colors is mandatory. For a complete reference,
# please check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors
# Example: sectionColor:lightGreen

# Counter images
# --------------
# You can provide an image for each of the counters with the parameter
# counterImage=path_to_counter_image. Supported formats include jpg, png and bmp.
# The software scales the images to 80 px wide, so is better to provide images
# with sizes close to 80 px wide for better performance.
# Example: counterImage=./myCounterImage.png

# Comments
# --------
# You can insert comments in the configuration file to describe each section,
# counter, etc. Inline comments are allowed. 

# Complete example
# ----------------
# [Section1]
# sectionColor=myHTMLColor
# [[Counter1-1]]
# KeyBinding=q
# counterImage=./MyCounterImage1.png
# [[Counter1-2]]
# KeyBinding=z
# counterImage=./MyCounterImage2.png
# [Section2]
# sectionColor=myHTMLColor2
# [[Counter2-1]]
# KeyBinding=r
# counterImage=./MyCounterImage3.png
